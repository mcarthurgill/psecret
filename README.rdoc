== This is my baby

I'm not sure exactly what I want to call this app, but the idea is similar to Whisper. 

If you have ever heard of postsecret (www.postsecret.com), it's a cool site where people send in their secrets in postcard form. I want to do something similar to that, but when you connect with a secret on the site, I want to put users in a one on one anonymous chat with someone else who connects with that secret. 

This is in the very beginning stages of development, but it is definitely a project I want to complete.
